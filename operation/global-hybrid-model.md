# Global Hybrid Model

The global hybrid expansion model enables startups, particularly those based in the USA, to effectively build international teams for key functions such as R&D, engineering, and customer support in lower-cost markets, while retaining core business activities including sales, marketing, and strategic leadership domestically. This handbook explores the benefits, challenges, and best practices associated with this approach.

## Economic Efficiency

- **Cost Reduction**: Establishing operational teams in countries like India, Ukraine, Poland, and Latin America can lower operational expenses significantly—often up to 60%—compared to purely domestic models.
- **Scalability**: Global talent pools enable startups to scale quickly, particularly in engineering and technical support roles.

## Talent Access

- Access to skilled talent proficient in English, particularly in regions known for strong engineering and technical capabilities (India, Eastern Europe).
- Opportunity to leverage specialized skills unique to certain geographic regions.

## Operational Flexibility

- Enhanced resilience against economic fluctuations.
- Ability to rapidly scale operations up or down based on market conditions and demand.

## Case Studies

### Robinhood and Revolut

- Both fintech startups successfully utilized hybrid models, creating tech hubs in Eastern Europe and Asia.
- Resulted in faster product iterations, reduced costs, and heightened competitiveness.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Legal and Compliance Issues
